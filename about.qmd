# Self-Introduction

My name is Choi Yun Yu, I am a British exchanger from the University of Sheffield. I took this module because I am going to be producing a thesis next academic year and R Studio is a cohesive and concise way to organise data.

The weather in Singapore is far too hot for me, but after nearly two semesters, I feel myself getting used to it. I fear that when I return to the UK (which is snowing right now) I will have to live in bundles of clothes and heaters.
