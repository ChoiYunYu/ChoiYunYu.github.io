# (1) List the visualisations that you are going to use in your project (What are the variables that you are going to plot? How will it answer your larger Q? Why are these the best?)

I think I am going to utilise grouped boxplots and/or grouped bar charts and/or line charts to visualise my data. 

My datasets include different dates of datacollection and I would like to compare them and see what trends happened over the months during Covid-19.

I chose these visualisations because it is easiest to see the different trends over time through these and the barcharts and boxplots make it easy to convey the confidence intervals.
```

```{r}
# (2) How do you plan to make it interactive? (What features of ggplot2/shiny/markdown do you plan to use?)

I think i will use ggplot2 most as this is what I am most comfortable with. I can use the Plotly package to allow users to hover over specific datapoints.

However, I can also use Shiny if the plotly plan does not work out as intended. Shiny allows easy utilisation of sliders, input boxes and dropdown menus, which the user can personal input to suit their needs.

I don't think i will use R markdown for this.

```{r}
# (3) What concepts incorporated in your project were taught in the course and which were self-taught? (Create a table with topics in one column and Weeks in the other to indicate which conept taught in which week is being used. Leave the entry of the Week column empty for self-learnt)
```

```{r}

#creating the inputs

concepts <- data.frame(
    concept = c("yes"),
    week = c("1")
)

print(concepts)
