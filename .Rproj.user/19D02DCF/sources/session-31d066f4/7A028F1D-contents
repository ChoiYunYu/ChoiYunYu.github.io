#(2) Why is this an important question? (Answer: 3 sentences, each of which has some

According to WHO, the pandemic triggered a global mental health crisis, with axniety being 
one of the most prevalent.

health interventions, and in the case of anxiety, mental health support initiatives. 
By analysing such data, we can debate what the underlying social determinants contribute 
to anxiety and by what extent.

Policy makers can then decide what the best course of action is for the country. 
They could develop targeted interventions to support vulnerbale populations or 
estimate/predict which policies would/n't work for which group of people.

That was my own fault though as I had misspelled github as githib.
