# Introduction: Why do we all need to learn how to cook?
Cooking, regardless of age, or gender, or marital status, is a vital skill to have in contemporary society. As individuals are no longer expected to stay as homemakers, there is no guarantee to coming home after work to a warm meal on the table. So you have to do it yourself:

#### Healthier Eating
Homemade cooked meals are generally healthier than eating outside of the home or ordering a takeaway, where they usually prioritise taste over health. Cooking your own meals allows you to control the ingredients and cooking methods, leading to healthier food choices. You can reduce reliance on processed foods, control portion sizes and add more nutitious ingredients, like fruits, vegetables and whole grains into your diet.

#### Cost
Eating out and ordering takeout regularly can be expensive, especially with rising delivery costs and tipping, as well as inflated prices online versus in store. Cooking at home can be more wallet-friendly, as you can buy ingredients in bulk, take advantage of sales and discounts, and minimise food waste by utilising leftovers. Furthermore, meal planning can save time and effort during a busy work week - therefore illustrating cooking as a cost and time effective chore.

#### Independence
Learning and knowing how to cook can empower you to take care of yourself and others. Whether you're living alone, with roommates, or starting a family, having basic cooking skills ensures that you can prepare nutritious meals and nourish yourself and your loved ones. It can also encourage confidence in other areas of life: if you can tackle this, why not other things?

#### Hobbies and Socialising
Cooking can be a creative outlet for experimentation with flavours, textures and techniques. Whether its by following a recipe or improvising on the go, cooking offers endless chances for exploration. Even customising recipes to suit your own tastes can make a meal uniquely yours. 
Therefore, cooking can become a shared activity between friends, families and even strangers. When cooking with friends and families, it can encourage teamwork and communication - sharing the meal also creates oppportunities for connection and memorable experiences.
Furthermore, online cooking forums or even in-person cooking classes can help improve your own skills, provide new recipes or twists on existing ones, or even socialise as a person. It is an easy hobby to easily make new friends and connections.

# Websites to learn how to cook

#### All Recipes
```{r, out.height= "100px",out.width= "400px",echo=FALSE,eval=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("allrecipes.png")
```
One of my favourite beginner websites is '[all recipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/)' because they provide so many helpful 'How-tos' and easy recipes compiled in one website. Can't think of what to make, but you know you want chicken? All Recipes compiles each recipe under an ingredient for easy searching. They also provide kitchen tips for different appliances, such as the instant pot, or an air fryer, even BBQ and Grilling. 

#### Food.com
```{r, out.height= "100px",out.width= "400px",echo=FALSE,eval=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("food.png")
```
'[Food.com](https://www.food.com/)' does something similar to 'All Recipes', compiling a list of easy recipes for you to choose from. However, what Food.com does differently is that these recipes are submitted, rated and reviewed by users worldwide who are passionate about food. 

#### Super Cook
```{r, out.height= "200px",out.width= "400px",echo=FALSE,eval=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("supercook.png")
```
'[SuperCook](https://www.supercook.com/#/desktop)' is a website where all you have to do is input the ingredients you have around the house, and it will generate recipes for you to select from. Perfect for those days when all your ingredients just don't seem to make sense together!
