My name is Yun. I am British Chinese. I have only used Stata to generate representations of data. Coding is interesting, but I suck at it. I major in Social Sciences with a pathway in sociology at the Univeristy of Sheffield.

The picture is not of me as I don't have one on my laptop, but I like cats so here is a picture of a sleepy orange cat. 

```{r, out.height= "250px",out.width= "700px",echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,fig.cap=" the orange cat is sleepy"}
knitr::include_graphics("cat.jpg") 
```
