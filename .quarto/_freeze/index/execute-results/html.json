Therefore, it was fairly simple to receive the dataset as excel tables. My only worry is converting it into a format suitable for R to work with.\n\nI am going to be looking at the coronavirus and how it affected people's daily lives. Although the dataset's title is 'Coronavirus and anxiety estimates', the survey questions don't actually involve coronavirus. It was conducted in 2020 (pandemic era) and asked about anxiety ratings affected by loneliness, marital status, sex, safety, work and disability.\n",
