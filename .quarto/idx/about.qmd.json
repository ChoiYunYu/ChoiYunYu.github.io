The analysis of such relations is essential because it sheds light on societal norms, household dynamics, and individual perceptions. Understanding how these all intersect can provide insights into various aspects of daily life, such as gender norms within the division of labour and cultural expectations.\n\n\n## Scatterplot Graph\n\nThis is a scatter graph illustrating self-rated cooking skills against age, with gender separated by colour. Women did not assess themselves below a six. Men were more scattered, albeit barely - a majority at the lower end of the scale with a few anomalies at 6, 8, and 10.
