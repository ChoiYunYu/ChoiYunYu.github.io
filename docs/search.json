I took this module because I am going to be producing a thesis next academic year and R Studio is a cohesive and concise way to organise data.\nThe weather in Singapore is far too hot for me, but after nearly two semesters, I feel myself getting used to it. I fear that when I return to the UK (which is snowing right now) I will have to live in bundles of clothes and heaters."

Therefore, it was fairly simple to receive the dataset as excel tables. My only worry is converting it into a format suitable for R to work with.\nI am going to be looking at the coronavirus and how it affected people’s daily lives. Although the dataset’s title is ‘Coronavirus and anxiety estimates’, the survey questions don’t actually involve coronavirus. It was conducted in 2020 (pandemic era) and asked about anxiety ratings affected by loneliness, marital status, sex, safety, work and disability."
