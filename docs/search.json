I took this module because I am going to be producing a thesis next academic year and R Studio is a cohesive and concise way to organise data.\nThe weather in Singapore is far too hot for me, but after nearly two semesters, I feel myself getting used to it. I fear that when I return to the UK (which is snowing right now) I will have to live in bundles of clothes and heaters."

(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mostafatamer/female-and-male)\nThis dataset contained information about a sample of men and women and their cooking skills (rated on their own assumption), descriptive data of their demographics, marital status, salary and education.\nThe columns I specifically focused on were gender, age, marital status and their self-proclaimed cooking skills. The analysis of such relations is essential because it sheds light on societal norms, household dynamics and individual perceptions. Understanding how these all intersect can provide insights into various aspects of daily life, such as gender norms within the division of labour and cultural expectations.\nIn many cultures, cooking is often associated with gender, with women traditionally expected to take on this responsibility and other housework chores. However, is this really true in the current era? A majority of professional chefs are recorded to be men.\nBy focusing on gender, age and marital status, we can explore how these factors influence an individual’s self-perceived culinary abilities. For example, are older men more experienced than their younger counterparts? Does marital status influence a woman cooking more, or a man cooking more than their single peers? Married individuals potentially have more opportunities to share meal preparation, seek to impress their partners or are more encouraged to try.\nThis analysis not only provides insights into individual behaviours and perceptions but also contributes to broader discussions about gender, household dynamics and cultural norms surrounding food and cooking."
