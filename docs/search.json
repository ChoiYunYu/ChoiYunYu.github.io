    "text": "Dataset\n\n\nIntroduction\nCooking skills are an essential aspect of daily life, whether male, female, married or single.\nIn this data story, we delve into a dataset that explores the relationship between cooking skills, age, and marital status among individuals of different genders.\n\n\nContext\nThis data story uses a dataset from Kaggle titled “Cooking Skills”.\n(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mostafatamer/female-and-male)\nThis dataset contained information about a sample of men and women and their cooking skills (rated on their own assumption), descriptive data of their demographics, marital status, salary and education.\nThe columns I specifically focused on were gender, age, marital status and their self-proclaimed cooking skills. The analysis of such relations is essential because it sheds light on societal norms, household dynamics and individual perceptions. Understanding how these all intersect can provide insights into various aspects of daily life, such as gender norms within the division of labour and cultural expectations.\nIn many cultures, cooking is often associated with gender, with women traditionally expected to take on this responsibility and other housework chores. However, is this really true in the current era? A majority of professional chefs are recorded to be men.\nBy focusing on gender, age and marital status, we can explore how these factors influence an individual’s self-perceived culinary abilities. For example, are older men more experienced than their younger counterparts? Does marital status influence a woman cooking more, or a man cooking more than their single peers? Married individuals potentially have more opportunities to share meal preparation, seek to impress their partners or are more encouraged to try.\nThis analysis not only provides insights into individual behaviours and perceptions but also contributes to broader discussions about gender, household dynamics and cultural norms surrounding food and cooking."

    "text": "Gender\nThis analysis of gender highlights the persistence of gender roles in today’s society and the continued impact on individual perception and behaviours, despite more depth and scholarly attention to gender studies. However, the anomalies of men rating themselves highly suggests a shift towards a slight shift in gender perspective by challenging gender norms.\n\n\nAge\nThis dataset suggests a small distinction between generations. Shifts in food exploration may have disregarded past culinary dishes; however, these dishes are being preserved through families and the easier dissemination of content. In contemporary societies, cooking can be seen as a hobby and a creative activity, driven by access to the internet, and thus exposure to various other cultures and culinary resources. \n\n\nMarital Status\nContrary to the gender statistics, marital status reflects a shift within society amongst gender roles, partnership dynamics, and the division of labour. Married individuals regardless of age were self-reportedly rated higher in terms of cooking skill - suggesting the subversion of traditional gender roles where men were the breadwinners, and women were housewives. Contributing to this is the shifts within the job market. As women became able to and eventually expected to contribute financially, it produced a triple shift of financial work, domestic work, and emotional work. However, as society has progressed into 2022, there is a higher expectation of men sharing this responsibility. Therefore, we can explore societal dynamics and their changes through this dataset. \nThe influence of the internet on these factors:\nWe cannot discuss shifts in society without discussing the effects of the internet. Digital technologies have grown exponentially in a few decades and is now central towards many aspects of life. The increased prevalence of cooking-related content on social media platforms (such as reels on TikTok or posts on Instagram) has widened knowledge, contributing to a more informed and confident approach to cooking among individuals regardless of demographic. This shift determines a more inclusive and accessible culinary culture, where cooking is seen as a creative skill to be cultivated by everyone. (Refer to men tho - still a bit iffy on that - but it now less ‘i cannot find a way to be informed’ and more ‘i lazy and CBA to learn/do it’)"

    "text": "Gender\nThe scatter plot illustrates that in the sample, women tended to rate their own cooking skills as higher than average compared to males, with a few anomalies. Through this, we can determine that gender norms and expectations (stemming from past historical contexts) can shape an individual’s perception. \nFor example, since ancient times, domesticity was the realm relegated to women, including household chores, children and cooking. Therefore, throughout the generations, this traditional mindset has stayed and women are still often being socialised and socially expected to take on these responsibilities - and thus feel a greater sense of confidence in their cooking skills when compared to men. Additionally, this socialisation may contribute to a woman’s awareness of domestic tasks, including cooking, leading to higher self-assessments. \nHowever, there are still anomalies, where men have rated themselves higher than average. I suggest that this is contextual and depends on the unique narratives of each individual. For example, some men may possess culinary expertise through careers, or personal interest. However, some men may inflate their own rating out of overconfidence or narcissism."

    "section": "Age",
    "text": "Age\nAs age increases, there seems to be a slight decline in self-reported cooking skills amongst both males and females. This trend suggests that younger individuals perceive themselves to be more proficient in cooking compared to the older generation. Looking at social factors and societal changes, it is possible to consider that older individuals may have developed a more modest perception of their cooking skills and a routine approach, viewing it as a daily task rather than a skill to be evaluated, especially in women. Furthermore, changing dietary norms and preferences over time may have played a role. Older individuals may be more accustomed to cooking dishes that are no longer popular or seen among the younger generation, leading them to feel less confident in their cooking skills when compared to the preferences of today’s society."

    "text": "Marital Status\nWhen considering marital status, regardless of gender, married individuals tend to rate their own cooking skills as higher than single people. This outcome suggests two plausible scenarios: either marriage had a positive effect on an individual’s cooking skills, such as sharing responsibilities within the kitchen or prioritising home-cooked meals instead of eating out or instant meals. Alternatively, it could be true that a spouse could exaggerate or inflate the respondent’s culinary skills, leading to a biased self-assessment."

As of right now, Yun has taken modules in journalism, social policy, sociology, psychology, law, gender studies, history and geography.\nShe initially chose this major because she was only slightly interested in Sociology, having taken it as a course in college and wasn’t cemented in what she wanted to do in the future, but as she progressed through her first academic year in university, she found that she really enjoyed the research process."
