    "text": "Introduction\nCooking skills are an essential aspect of daily life, whether male, female, married or single.\nIn this data story, we delve into a dataset that explores the relationship between cooking skills, age, and marital status among individuals of different genders.\n\n\nContext\nThis data story uses a dataset from Kaggle titled “Cooking Skills”.\nIn many cultures, cooking is often associated with gender, with women traditionally expected to take on this responsibility and other housework chores. However, is this really true in the current era? A majority of professional chefs are recorded to be men.\nBy focusing on gender, age and marital status, we can explore how these factors influence an individual’s self-perceived culinary abilities. For example, are older men more experienced than their younger counterparts? Does marital status influence a woman cooking more, or a man cooking more than their single peers? Married individuals potentially have more opportunities to share meal preparation, seek to impress their partners or are more encouraged to try.\nThis analysis not only provides insights into individual behaviours and perceptions but also contributes to broader discussions about gender, household dynamics and cultural norms surrounding food and cooking."

    "text": "Introduction: Why do we all need to learn how to cook?\nCooking, regardless of age, or gender, or marital status, is a vital skill to have in contemporary society. As individuals are no longer expected to stay as homemakers, there is no guarantee to coming home after work to a warm meal on the table. So you have to do it yourself:\n\nHealthier Eating\nHomemade cooked meals are generally healthier than eating outside of the home or ordering a takeaway, where they usually prioritise taste over health. Cooking your own meals allows you to control the ingredients and cooking methods, leading to healthier food choices. You can reduce reliance on processed foods, control portion sizes and add more nutitious ingredients, like fruits, vegetables and whole grains into your diet.\n\n\nCost\nEating out and ordering takeout regularly can be expensive, especially with rising delivery costs and tipping, as well as inflated prices online versus in store. Cooking at home can be more wallet-friendly, as you can buy ingredients in bulk, take advantage of sales and discounts, and minimise food waste by utilising leftovers. Furthermore, meal planning can save time and effort during a busy work week - therefore illustrating cooking as a cost and time effective chore.\n\n\nIndependence\nLearning and knowing how to cook can empower you to take care of yourself and others. Whether you’re living alone, with roommates, or starting a family, having basic cooking skills ensures that you can prepare nutritious meals and nourish yourself and your loved ones. It can also encourage confidence in other areas of life: if you can tackle this, why not other things?\n\n\nHobbies and Socialising\nCooking can be a creative outlet for experimentation with flavours, textures and techniques. Whether its by following a recipe or improvising on the go, cooking offers endless chances for exploration. Even customising recipes to suit your own tastes can make a meal uniquely yours. Therefore, cooking can become a shared activity between friends, families and even strangers. When cooking with friends and families, it can encourage teamwork and communication - sharing the meal also creates oppportunities for connection and memorable experiences. Furthermore, online cooking forums or even in-person cooking classes can help improve your own skills, provide new recipes or twists on existing ones, or even socialise as a person. It is an easy hobby to easily make new friends and connections.\n\n\n\nWebsites to learn how to cook\n\nAll Recipes\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of my favourite beginner websites is ‘all recipes’ because they provide so many helpful ‘How-tos’ and easy recipes compiled in one website. Can’t think of what to make, but you know you want chicken? All Recipes compiles each recipe under an ingredient for easy searching. They also provide kitchen tips for different appliances, such as the instant pot, or an air fryer, even BBQ and Grilling.\n\n\nFood.com\n\n\n\n\n\n‘Food.com’ does something similar to ‘All Recipes’, compiling a list of easy recipes for you to choose from. However, what Food.com does differently is that these recipes are submitted, rated and reviewed by users worldwide who are passionate about food.\n\n\nSuper Cook\n\n\n\n\n\n‘SuperCook’ is a website where all you have to do is input the ingredients you have around the house, and it will generate recipes for you to select from. Perfect for those days when all your ingredients just don’t seem to make sense together!\n\n\n\nMy favourite recipes\nHint Hint: You can skip past the recipe autobiographies by typing ‘cooked.wiki/’ before the website url!\nMashed potatoes with tomato sauce Preparation time: 20 Min Cooking time: 50 Min\nTip: I like to add cream cheese to this for a creamier texture! Sprinkle with cheese if you like a cheesier taste.\n\n\n\n\n\nKimchi Fried Rice\n\n\n\n\n\nHong Shao Rou Prepartion time: 15 Min Cooking time: 1 Hour\n\n\n\n\n\nLasagna Preparation time: 20 Mins Cooking time: 4 Hours"

    "text": "Gender\nThe scatter plot illustrates that in the sample, women tended to rate their own cooking skills as higher than average compared to males, with a few anomalies. Through this, we can determine that gender norms and expectations (stemming from past historical contexts) can shape an individual’s perception. \nFor example, since ancient times, domesticity was the realm relegated to women, including household chores, children and cooking. Therefore, throughout the generations, this traditional mindset has stayed and women are still often being socialised and socially expected to take on these responsibilities - and thus feel a greater sense of confidence in their cooking skills when compared to men. Additionally, this socialisation may contribute to a woman’s awareness of domestic tasks, including cooking, leading to higher self-assessments. \nHowever, there are still anomalies, where men have rated themselves higher than average. I suggest that this is contextual and depends on the unique narratives of each individual. For example, some men may possess culinary expertise through careers, or personal interest. However, some men may inflate their own rating out of overconfidence or narcissism."

This trend suggests that younger individuals perceive themselves to be more proficient in cooking compared to the older generation. Looking at social factors and societal changes, it is possible to consider that older individuals may have developed a more modest perception of their cooking skills and a routine approach, viewing it as a daily task rather than a skill to be evaluated, especially in women. Furthermore, changing dietary norms and preferences over time may have played a role. Older individuals may be more accustomed to cooking dishes that are no longer popular or seen among the younger generation, leading them to feel less confident in their cooking skills when compared to the preferences of today’s society."

Alternatively, it could be true that a spouse could exaggerate or inflate the respondent’s culinary skills, leading to a biased self-assessment."

    "text": "Age\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA look at the graphs reveals interesting patterns regarding age and one’s own self-reported cooking skills. Younger individuals consistently rate themselves higher in cooking proficiency, reflecting a generational shift in attitudes towards culinary skills.\n\n\nThis generational difference can therefore be attributed to reflecting attitudes towards food preparation and domestic responsibilities. Historically, cooking was majorly associated with femininity and was a core task for the housewife. However as societal norms have changed with time, so has this mindset. Gradually, society has shifted towards breaking out of these roles - now mostly expecting both genders to work and participate in the household. Consequently, younger generations may have greater confidence in their cooking skills, irrespective of gender due to a more equal distribution of domestic chores.\nMoreover, for older generations, cooking was often primarily viewed as a necessary chore, driven by practicality. This is reinforced by making cooking as a domestic obligation for housewives rather than a leisure activity - therefore older individuals may approach cooking as a sense of duty, and thus rate their own cooking lower. In contrast, younger generations are now more likely to view cooking as a hobby or as a form of self-expression. Food can be easily accessed through buying ready meals, or eating out or a takeaway - yet some people choose to cook and are enthused due to increased exposure. Cooking is also now easier. For example, the availability of pre-packaged ingredients and convenience foods has made cooking less intimidating for novices - for instance, pe-cut vegetables, single-serving grains, and meal kits - which cut out the need for extensive meal preparation and skills, and thus allowing individuals of today to create home-made meals with minimal effort, and build confidence.\nFurthermore, the proliferation of the internet has increased exposure to culinary influences through media, education and social networks - easily distributing new techniques and cuisine to those who use media; more often the younger generation. There is greater access to culinary resources, as the internet has freely democratised access, making it easier to have cooking tutorials, recipes and knowledge on one screen. Media platforms like YouTube, cooking websites, interactive cooking forums, and social media provide a vast range of multimodal dissemination to cater to a wider range of audiences. Therefore, the internet can serve as a virtual culinary classroom - with the user as the student.\n\n\n  TL;DR\n\n\n\n  Generational Shifts: Younger individuals consistently rate themselves higher in cooking proficiency, reflecting a generational shift in attitudes towards culinary skills.\n\nTraditional Gender Roles: Older individuals may adopt a more modest perception of their cooking skills due to entrenched gender norms and societal expectations prevalent during their formative years.\n\nChore vs Hobby: Older generations may have viewed cooking as a necessary chore, however, younger generations have tools that help them view it as a hobby.\n\nCulinary Influences: Increased exposure to culinary influences through media, education, and social networks may contribute to heightened confidence in cooking abilities among younger generations."

    "section": "Marital Status",
    "text": "Marital Status\nMarried individuals reported a high cooking skill compared to their single counterparts - except for single women.\nFirstly, within marital relationships, it is more likely that responsibilities are shared, including cooking. Therefore, there may be more opportunities for both partners to develop and refine their cooking skills. This can then improve confidence and actual skill level, as they would actively be practising to contribute to cooking for the household. The dynamics within the household can influence routines and traditions around food, reflecting values, preferences and cultural background. For, example, some couples may view cooking as a way to promote health, whilst others may view cooking as a creative outlet or a sign of expression to share with each other. These household dynamics shape individuals’ attitudes towards cooking and contribute to their self-assessment of cooking skills, which may vary depending on the level of involvement and satisfaction with their role in the kitchen. Furthermore, cooking together can strengthen bonds within the relationship.\nHowever, on the other hand, married individuals are more likely to taste another’s cooking, or receive more feedback on their own cooking, which influences their own perception. This is especially true for couples with children, who are then needed to be catered to, and may even insult the food. Single individuals, in contrast, are like an echo chamber. They are able to cook to their own preferences, thus more likely to rate themselves higher.\nSecondly, in contrast, single individuals can approach cooking in two ways. One is that being single has increased responsibility and independence. Without a partner to share responsibility, single people have greater autonomy and flexibility with their cooking choices - but other than that, they must either learn to cook, or to constantly eat outside of the home - which is expensive on a single income. Additionally, single individuals may prioritise efficiency, opting for quick and easy meal choices that require minimal preparation, and thus build their confidence in their skills.\nHowever, another way to see this is that due to the extensive amount of ready-made meals and takeaways available, single individuals may opt for those options if they can afford it. Accentuating this is the rising inflation in some countries. For example, in Singapore, the cost of groceries often is on par with eating outside, making it redundant to buy fresh produce and cook your own meals when it could be prepared for you for the same cost.\nThis disparity between genders (where single women rate themselves far higher than single men) may be attributed to healthy eating and body image. Women are often more aware of their food choices. Body image and food go hand in hand, and as women are socialised in the modern age to always aim to look ‘instgrammable’ (AKA thin and long proportions, with curves in the ‘right places’), and as fast food is frequently made with high levels of sodium and oil (taste over health) women are more likely to cook at home. Men, however, often are not placed with the same restrictions and may eat out as they wish.\n\n\n  TL;DR\n\n\n\n  Shared Responsibilities: Within marital relationships, shared responsibilities and collaborative efforts in the kitchen may contribute to a sense of confidence and competence in cooking.\n\n  Household Dynamics: Cooking practices and perceptions are influenced by household dynamics, with married individuals often viewing cooking as a shared responsibility or a means of nurturing familial bonds.\n\n  Singlehood Perspectives: Single individuals may approach cooking from a perspective of self-sufficiency or convenience, leading to varied self-assessment scores based on individual preferences and priorities.\n\n  Diverse Motivations: The presence of outliers among single individuals underscores the diverse motivations and experiences that shape self-assessment, ranging from personal interest to cultural influences."

    "text": "Density Plot - Gender + Cooking Skills\nThis is a density plot illustrating the density of genders against self-rated cooking skills. By examining the curves and peaks, we can analyse patterns in how cooking skills are perceived within each gender.\n  \nOur first notice is that among men, the density curve tends to skew towards the lower end of the self-assessment, with a prominent peak at 2.5 or 3, suggesting that a considerable proportion of men in the sample perceive their own cooking skills as relatively low.\nWomen, however, display a different pattern, favouring the higher end of the spectrum. The plot clearly displays noticeable and taller peaks at rankings 8 and 10, suggesting a substantial sample of women rate their cooking skills higher."

It also filters the genders. Here, you can see that women did not rank themselves lower than a 6, regardless of marital status. Interestingly, it was only married men who rated themselves higher than an 8. It was also interesting that only men considered their marital status as “other” (ranked on the lower spectrum of 2 and 5). In the overall table, the higher rankings are dominated by single people - however a look at the genders shows that this is majorly due to single women. For example, no single men rated themselves above a 6, therefore, above this was all single women."

Among the male respondents, it was only the married men who rated themselves higher than an 8, suggesting that married individuals are influenced by the domestic responsibilities associated with familial roles.\nContrastingly, single women tended to rank themselves higher than their married counterparts, suggesting self-confidence and self-reliance associated with single-hood - where individuals may invest more in developing their cooking skills as a means of self-sufficiency.\nSingle men, however, did not rank themselves as high - none passing a score of 6, hinting at a possible lack of emphasis on cooking skills in their lifestyles.\nIn the overall table, the higher rankings are dominated by single people - however, a look at the genders shows that this is majorly due to single women.\nIt was also interesting that only men labeled their marital status as “other” (ranked on the lower spectrum of 2 and 5)."

    "text": "Representative\nWhile this data set brings valuable insights to the self-assessed cooking skills of different demographics. It is important to understand that certain groups may be underrrepresented in this dataset.\n\nSampling Bias + Self-Assessment\n“Sampling bias occurs when some members of a population are systematically more likely to be selected in a sample than others.”(Bhandari, 2020)\nThere may be overrepresentation of certain groups within this dataset. In this survey, participation was voluntary, which introduces the possibility of self-selection bias. People who were enthusiastic about sharing their cooking skills were more likely to participate, potentially skewing the results. Self-assessment can be subjective and influenced by various factors, including social desirability bias, where individuals may provide responses they perceive as socially acceptable.\nTraditionally, cooking has been associated with women’s domestic roles, which could influence participation. Women who didn’t rate themselves highly might have been less inclined to participate or lie, fearing embarrassment and negative evaluation. Afterall, there are mindsets that state that if they could not do the one thing that they were expected to do since young, it would cause social stigma.\nOn the other hand, men who adhered to traditional gender norms or valued masculinity might have been proud to rate themselves lower, as it aligned with societal expectations of men avoiding feminine tasks like cooking.\nThis bias in participation could impact both the validity and representativeness of the sample. It’s possible that women were overrepresented among those who rated themselves highly, while men might have been more prevalent among those who rated themselves lower. As a result, the survey results may not accurately reflect the full range of cooking skills in the population.\n\n\nGeneralisation\nGeneralisability refers to the extent of how the findings of a study can be applied to a larger population beyond the sample that was studied.\nThe dataset “Cooking Skills” is limited in this as there was a limited number of respondents - inadequately representing the diversity of individuals worldwide.\nFirstly, there are cultural and regional variations. For example, different regions may have different social norms, affecting an individual’s daily life and their perception of themselves. A dataset from a single culture will not capture this diversity.\nSecondly, other factors, such as socioeconomic background, race, and education level was not taken into account in this data story. For example, those with higher socioeconomic status may have greater access to culinary education, diverse ingredients and kitchen equipment, enhancing their cooking skills. However, on the flip side, having a higher socioeconomic background could also mean that individuals would not need to cook, and could simply eat out or order food. Similarly, those in lower tax brackets may have limited access to fresh ingredients, or have time constraints due to work or caregiving responsibilities, and thus may need to resort to ready-made meals. However, a lower socioeconomic income could also mean that individuals prefer to meal plan and prepare their own food to save costs and time."
