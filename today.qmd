title: "What the Data says about Society Today"

# Gender

This analysis of gender highlights the persistence of gender roles in today’s society and the continued impact on individual perception and behaviours, despite more depth and scholarly attention to gender studies. However, the anomalies of men rating themselves highly suggests a shift towards a slight shift in gender perspective by challenging gender norms.

# Age

This dataset suggests a small distinction between generations. Shifts in food exploration may have disregarded past culinary dishes; however, these dishes are being preserved through families and the easier dissemination of content. In contemporary societies, cooking can be seen as a hobby and a creative activity, driven by access to the internet, and thus exposure to various other cultures and culinary resources. 

# Marital Status

Contrary to the gender statistics, marital status reflects a shift within society amongst gender roles, partnership dynamics, and the division of labour. Married individuals regardless of age were self-reportedly rated higher in terms of cooking skill - suggesting the subversion of traditional gender roles where men were the breadwinners, and women were housewives. Contributing to this is the shifts within the job market. As women became able to and eventually expected to contribute financially, it produced a triple shift of financial work, domestic work, and emotional work. However, as society has progressed into 2022, there is a higher expectation of men sharing this responsibility. Therefore, we can explore societal dynamics and their changes through this dataset. 

The influence of the internet on these factors:

We cannot discuss shifts in society without discussing the effects of the internet. Digital technologies have grown exponentially in a few decades and is now central towards many aspects of life. The increased prevalence of cooking-related content on social media platforms (such as reels on TikTok or posts on Instagram) has widened knowledge, contributing to a more informed and confident approach to cooking among individuals regardless of demographic. This shift determines a more inclusive and accessible culinary culture, where cooking is seen as a creative skill to be cultivated by everyone. (Refer to men tho - still a bit iffy on that - but it now less ‘i cannot find a way to be informed’ and more ‘i lazy and CBA to learn/do it’)
