# Introduction

Cooking skills are an essential aspect of daily life, whether male, female, married or single.

In this data story, we delve into a dataset that explores the relationship between cooking skills, age, and marital status among individuals of different genders.

# Context

This data story uses a dataset from Kaggle titled "[Cooking Skills](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mostafatamer/female-and-male)".

In many cultures, cooking is often associated with gender, with women traditionally expected to take on this responsibility and other housework chores. However, is this really true in the current era? A majority of professional chefs are recorded to be men.

By focusing on gender, age and marital status, we can explore how these factors influence an individualâ€™s self-perceived culinary abilities. For example, are older men more experienced than their younger counterparts? Does marital status influence a woman cooking more, or a man cooking more than their single peers? Married individuals potentially have more opportunities to share meal preparation, seek to impress their partners or are more encouraged to try.

This analysis not only provides insights into individual behaviours and perceptions but also contributes to broader discussions about gender, household dynamics and cultural norms surrounding food and cooking.
